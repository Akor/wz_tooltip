Modifications where performed to:
    -limit the scope of private functions & vars (disabled plugin API for now)
    -remove some (but not yet all) eval uses
    -take DOMNode objects in addition to id strings as tooltips
    -replace tooltips in html like this (mind the class names):
        <span class='customTooltip'>
            <span class='tooltip'>This is the tooltip</span>
            This is the Caption
        </span>
